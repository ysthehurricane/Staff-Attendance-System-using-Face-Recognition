# Staff-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition

This is a real time attendance system to mark attendace of staff on daily basis. In this project, I have used Face Detection technique to recogize the face of staff members.
For that, I have collected staff faces and applying some image processing techniques such as image filteration, image segmentation and image augmentation for generating more data collection in model training.
